# prodev-mobile-setup
## How I set up this project
* I download node.js v22 LTS. Then I installed it.
    It had connflict with the v24 I previously installed. so I went to control panel-programs and unstalled node.js. I also went to c:user/program/node and system environment/system variables and check if any node trace is seen and deletd them. Then I intalled the v22 again and it worked.
* I cloned the repo prodev-mobile-setup to my system using vs code
* I went to https://expo.dev/go and it prompted me to download it true app store or google play store (which i choosed play store because am using android).
* I created an account and login
